This is my attempt to make an open source version of a book editting piece of software, one of the best is scruvner.  However, as good as scrivner is, it has a few problems:

1) It costs money
2) It has way to many fioddly bits that can be used to take time away when you should be writing
3) There is no linux version.

Ths program is intended to address these three issues.  It is open source and free to modify and use. It uses a simple outline format and tags to represent the book.  That's it.  Not a while lot of things you can play with.  It allows basic editing and formatting.  It also will run on windows, linux and macos because it uses the open source version of Qt5.

Enjoy and welcome to BookSmith!
