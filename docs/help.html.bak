    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to BookSmith!</h1>
    <p>BookSmith is a very simple, but complete, novel authoring software
      package.&nbsp; To be blunt, most other novel authoring software is either
      overkill for the job needed or woefully under powered for the job at
      hand.&nbsp; Most of the complete software I have used have so many bells
      and whistles built in that I can spend hours just tinkering with things
      instead of writing (looking at you, Scriviner!).&nbsp; Others are simply
      glorified word processors without the needed organization tools to give
      the author the freedom to create (Word!).</p>
    <p>BookSmith is different.&nbsp; It is organized around the scene.&nbsp;
      Scenes can be grouped, tagged and edited.&nbsp; That is it.&nbsp;
      Depending on how you want to export the novel there are certain tags and
      organizations techniques you can use.&nbsp; The good thing is you don't
      have to decide that now! You can go back later and organize things quickly
      and easily.&nbsp; But there are not a lot of options or toggles.&nbsp;
      Everything is accomplished simply.&nbsp; You can bold text, but font
      selection is right out.&nbsp; You can center some thing, but changing how
      a paragraph looks on the page is a no-no.&nbsp; There is no color coding
      things (maybe I'm biased, being mostly color blind, but coloring things
      just seems like a good way to spend time fiddling rather than
      writing).&nbsp; Free form tags are used for everything in a dull, simple
      and intuitive dialog.&nbsp; You really only spend as much time as needed
      in it and that's all.</p>
    <p>Now, after the preaching, it's time to take a tour of the interface,
      which shouldn't take too long.</p>
    <h2>Thousand foot view</h2>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><img src="docs/UI.png" alt="UI image" title="UI"></div>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">This is the window you will see every time
      you start BookSmith.&nbsp; I've opened a book I am personally working on
      so you can see how things look.At the very top is the name of program
      along with the standard OS decorations.&nbsp; The next line is the menu
      (on Macs, this menu line is always at the top of the screen). The next
      line has the toolbar, with lots of common operations on it.&nbsp; If you
      move the mouse pointer over the icons you will see what menu item the icon
      corresponds to as well as what the keyboard shortcut is.&nbsp; The bottom
      line on the window has the current word count since you opened the file
      and the total word count of the document.&nbsp; As you can see, I really
      have not done all that much yet...</div>
    <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: left;">In the middle are two boxes.&nbsp; On the
      left is the novel's outline, and on the right is the current scene's
      text.&nbsp; As you can see, just because it is called a chapter doesn't
      mean it can't contain text and in most cases it probably should.&nbsp; I
      use it as a way to set off the chapter with a quote and some space at the
      top of the scene to set it off from the previous chapter.&nbsp; Each
      exporter will handle this kind of thing in a different way, and we'll
      cover that when we get to that section.</div>
    <h2>Constant Usage</h2>
    <p>In this part of the help we are going to go over the things you will be
      doing in the program with an intent to show how the program tries to make
      your life easier.&nbsp; Some things are going to be explained later
      because they are deserving of an entire discussion themselves, like
      exporting for example.&nbsp; The first thing we need to go over are all of
      the menus.&nbsp; The menus aare where you go when you want to do something
      and aren't sure if the program allows it... kind of a shortcut help.</p>
    <h3>Menus</h3>
    <p>The menus are organized into groups by the things you are doing.</p>
    <h4>File</h4>
    <img src="docs/File.png" alt="File menu" title="File menu">
    <p>The File menu deals with, you guessed it, file handling. It is very
      simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>'New' gets rid of any current novel and leaves you withe a fresh new
        one. As a bonus, BookSmith remembers where you put dialogs that pop up
        from time to time and New will remember that information.&nbsp; If there
        are any changes in the current novel that aren't saved, you be asked
        what to do at that point.</li>
      <li>'Open' works similarly to New above, except that it opens an already
        existing novel.&nbsp; If there are changes in the current novel, relax
        as Open will also ask you what to do.&nbsp; The dialog positions are
        stored in each novel, so if you have a favorite position for things on
        the screen, you can be assured that that's where things will go.&nbsp;
        It also remembers the location and size of the main window and the width
        of the full screen page ... more on that later.</li>
      <li>'Save' puts any changes in the current novel and writes it to disk for
        safety.&nbsp; If there is not yet a title set for the novel, Save will
        ask you for one and set the first line of the novel structure to that
        title for you.</li>
      <li>'Save As' let's you save the novel with a new name if you would
        like.&nbsp; This is handy when you start revising your noivel.&nbsp; You
        can save it under a new name, perhaps adding ', revised' to the
        name.&nbsp; If in the middle of the revision you realize you have made a
        terrible error you can go back to the original.</li>
      <li>'Export' is a whole other subject.&nbsp; For now, it's enough to know
        you can export a copy of the novel as plain text, an open document
        format file, a PDF, or even an Epub file.&nbsp; More exporters will be
        added as needed by my adoring fans.</li>
      <li>'Exit' stops editing the current novel and closes BookSmith.&nbsp;
        Again, it will ask you what to do if there are any unsaved changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Scene</h4>
    <p><img src="docs/Scene.png" alt="Scene menu" title="Scene"></p>
    <p>The Scene menu lets you create, delete and move scenes around in the
      outline.&nbsp; Not the shortcuts in the menu, they make it very easy to do
      all of this from the keyboard.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>'New' creates a new empty scene in the novel subordinate to (within)
        the current scene. If there are already scenes there, it is placed at
        the end.&nbsp; Never fear, a scene can easily be moved from place to
        place.&nbsp; The current scene remains current.&nbsp; This let's you
        create several scenes in the same place all at once easily.</li>
      <li>'Delete' removes the current scene. <span style="color: red;">WARNING!<span
            style="color: black;"> Once a scene is deleted, it can't be brought
            back (yet).&nbsp; Maybe just move the offending scene under a trash
            scene until you are sure.</span></span></li>
      <li>'Move Up' swaps the scene directly above (at the same level) with the
        current scene. The current scene remains current.&nbsp; By doing this
        with all of the moves you can keep moving the scene around until you are
        happy with where it is without having to keep selecting it again.</li>
      <li>'Move Down' swaps the scene directly below (at the same level, again)
        with the current scene.</li>
      <li>'Move In' makes the scene directly above it (at the same level) the
        parent of the current scene effectively moving it underneath, or into,
        that scene.</li>
      <li>'Move Out' moves the scene to the same level as the former parent,
        immediately after the parent scene.&nbsp; This moves it out of the
        parent scene.&nbsp; Of course, you can't move a scene out of the novel
        itself.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Edit</h4>
    <p><img src="docs/Edit.png" alt="Edit menu" title="Edit"></p>
    <p>The Edit menu is where you will probably spend most of your time
      looking.&nbsp; It's really the heart of writing and organizing, and dare I
      say it, editing a novel.&nbsp; I've tried to make everything usable from
      the keyboard while still making sense.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>'Cut' copies the selected text to the clipboard and deletes it from
        the scene being edited.</li>
      <li>'Copy' works similarly to Cut, but does not delete the highlighted
        text.</li>
      <li>'Paste' takes what is in the clipboard and inserts it into the current
        scene at the current cursor location.</li>
      <li>'Find' lets you look for text in the a lot of ways.&nbsp; More about
        this later.</li>
      <li>'Replace' lets you find and replace text in the novel in a variety of
        ways, again, details forth coming.</li>
      <li>'Bold' toggles bold text on and off at the locations or selection.</li>
      <li>'Italic' like bold, but with italics.</li>
      <li>'Underline' see the above two, but replace bold with underline.</li>
      <li>'Left' changes the current paragraph, or selection, to be left
        justified.</li>
      <li>'Center' changes the current paragraph, or selection, to be centered.</li>
      <li>'Right' changes the current paragraph, or selection, to be right
        justified.</li>
      <li>'Justify' changes the current paragraph, or selection, to be full
        justified (aligned right and left margins).</li>
      <li>'Indent' changes the start of the paragraph to be moved right a
        bit.&nbsp; Can be repeated for deeper indents.</li>
      <li>'Outdent' undoes the last indent.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>View</h4>
    <p><img src="docs/View.png" alt="View Menu" title="View"></p>
    <p>The View menu lets you look at stuff and change how you see the editor. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>'About' displays a simple dialog that describes the program, it's aims
        and the tools used to make it.</li>
      <li>'Help' just shows this file.&nbsp; If you are reading this, you
        probably figured that out already.</li>
      <li>'Full Screen' goes into distraction free mode.&nbsp; The margins can
        be adjusted, just click in the right or left side of the page and move
        it to widen or narrow it until it's the way you like it.&nbsp; BookSmith
        will remember this for you the next time you go full screen.&nbsp; The
        Edit menu control sequences still work, as well as the
        File-&gt;Save.&nbsp; There are no menus available ... they are a
        distraction!&nbsp; To get back to the main window mode, just press the
        'Esc' key.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Book Outline</h3>
    <p>The root of the outline is the novel's name.&nbsp; You can't edit a scene
      for this, because it just makes no sense.&nbsp; You can you tag it, but it
      might be a little odd since you can't edit anything.&nbsp; It's just the
      novel's title.&nbsp; The little arrow off the the left either points right
      or it points down.&nbsp; If it points right, you can't see anything
      directly beneath and inside it.&nbsp; If it points down you can. Each item
      with subordinate items has one.&nbsp; This lets you narrow your view of
      the book down to the area you are working on if you need to.</p>
    <h4>Tagging</h4>
    <h4><img src="docs/Tagging.png" alt="Tagging dialog" title="Tagging"></h4>
    <h4> </h4>
    <p>Tagging is done very simply.&nbsp; Double click on a scene.&nbsp; Here is
      where you can name the scene.&nbsp; Type a tag in the box and press
      return.&nbsp; Tag created.&nbsp; Click on the tag.&nbsp; Tag
      removed.&nbsp; It's that simple.&nbsp; In this case, I noted that this is
      actually a scene (used by the exporters, see below) and I have decided it
      would be useful to know who the point of view character is (Karl).&nbsp; I
      would also maybe put in the location and the other characters as
      well.&nbsp; Not really needed, just useful to me as the author.&nbsp; Feel
      free to use it like you want.&nbsp; Not a pretty thing, but useful.</p>
    <p>If you hit 'OK' the changes are saved in the novel. If instead you hit
      'Cancel' they are tossed out like the trash.</p>
    <h3>Text editing</h3>
    <p>For the most part editing is just what you expect.&nbsp; You type words,
      you highlight things, you can cut and paste things.&nbsp; Things work like
      you expect them to, the way they work in the hundreds, if not thousands,
      of other editors out there.&nbsp; It isn't until finding and replacing
      that things get a different.</p>
    <h4>Searching and Replacing </h4>
    <p>Because of the way BookSmith organizes novels along scenes and those
      scenes into outlines, searching and replacing are more complicated, but
      still pretty understandable.</p>
    <p><img src="docs/Search.png" alt="Search dialog" title="Search"> </p>
    <p>Like normal, type what you want to find in the text box.&nbsp; Below that
      things get interesting. If you have selected some text, BookSmith will
      assume you want to search in that text and highlight that option.&nbsp; If
      nothing is highlighted, it will assume you want to seach just int he
      current scene.&nbsp; The other options expand the search further. They are
      pretty understandable once you know the jargon:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Children refers to everything beneath the current scene that would be
        hidden if the arrow to the left is facing right (see the book outline
        above).</li>
      <li>Siblings refer to the scenes that have the same immediate parent (at
        the same level in the outline and under the same scene).</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="docs/Found.png" alt="Found dialog" title="Found">
    <p>Once you are ready, hit the 'OK' button.&nbsp; When BookSmith finds the
      text you are looking for, it highlights it and asks you if you want to go
      on ('Yes') or stop ('No').&nbsp; If you say yes it continues looking for
      the next match.&nbsp; If it ever doesn't find a match, it tells you the
      search is done.</p>
    <p>Replace is similar to Find except there is the option to replace what you
      found with something else (even nothing!).</p>
    <p><img src="docs/Replace.png" alt="Replace dialog" title="Repalce"></p>
    <p>Once the string is found you can replace that particular match and go to
      the next one, replace all remaining matches as well, don't replace this
      one, or just stop.</p>
    <img src="docs/ReplaceIt.png" alt="ReplaceIt dialog" title="ReplaceIt">
    <h3>Exporting</h3>
    <p>The final, and some would say most important, part of writing a novel is
      sharing it with others.&nbsp; BookSmith makes this pretty easy.&nbsp; You
      can export the novel you have written in several formats: Text, ODF, PDF
      and Epub.&nbsp; Each of these formats uses the tags to determine what to
      output and how to output it.&nbsp; Not all of them use all of the tags,
      and int he future more tags may be added to particular formats, or more
      formats may be added!&nbsp; The file name used is the book name plus the
      accepted extension for the file type.</p>
    <h4>Plain Text</h4>
    <p>This is by far the simplest way to export your novel.&nbsp; It looks for
      'chapter' and 'scene' tags ini order.&nbsp; It then strips out all of the
      fancy bold, italic and underlines and dumps the text to a file ending with
      the '.txt' extension.&nbsp; Page breaks are put in before chapters and
      scenes are separated by blank lines.</p>
    <h4>ODF (Open Document Format)</h4>
    <p>The open document format is just what it says, a document format that can
      be opened by most word processing applications.&nbsp; These files end with
      '.odf'. It's more portable than the the more common word document or rtf
      file. This format keeps all of the fancy letter formatting and, like the
      text format, it looks at chapter and scene tags.&nbsp; In addition it
      looks for a cover tag.&nbsp; In that scene it expects to find a path to a
      jpeg or png file to be used as the cover on the very front of the
      document.&nbsp; </p>
    <h4>Adobe PDF</h4>
    <p>PDF files are an extremely common ay to distribute books on the internet,
      and I would be remiss not including them. These files end in '.pdf' and
      the tags it looks for are identical to ODF above.</p>
    <h4>Epub (for EBook readers)</h4>
    <p>Epub is one of two popular Electronic Book formats (EBook for
      short).&nbsp; The other format is Mobi, which is used by Kindle.&nbsp; I
      have not yet found a description of the details of the mobi format so I
      can't convert a book to it. Other tools exist to convert from epub to mobi
      and back so it's not that big as problem.&nbsp; I am working on it
      though.&nbsp; Watch this space!</p>
    <p>The format itslef ends in '.epub' and uses all of the tags of ODF and
      PDF, while adding several more:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style=" color:#bec0c2;"></span>"author": List the authors of the
        book in this scene separated by commas.&nbsp; Pretty simple.
      </li>
      <li> "rights": What rights the author(s) are keeping or giving away.&nbsp;
        This defaults to "Public Domain" if you don't put one here.&nbsp; A
        simple copyright , the year and who by is probably sufficient</li>
      <li>"language": What language is the novel in, it defaults to
        'en-US'.&nbsp; If you change this, do it write or some book readers
        might reject it (unlikely, but some books sites might miss-file it which
        would a tragedy).</li>
      <li>"publisher": This defaults to 'self'.&nbsp; Which is probably all
        that's needed unless you are publishing a book by someone else, in which
        case put your contact information here.</li>
      <li>"id": This is a tricky one.&nbsp; If you don't supply one, the program
        will generate one for you.&nbsp; There is no simple way to see they id
        it generated, and you should be consistent in using it for all versions
        of the ebook you produce.&nbsp; It's probably best to generate this one
        if you anticipate updating the book (always anticipate this).&nbsp; I
        recommend the site:
        https://www.guidgenerator.com/online-guid-generator.aspx and select
        hyphens and uppercase.&nbsp; Then generate one,&nbsp; copy it and paste
        it into this scene and forget about it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's all there is!&nbsp; Get out there and edit!</p>
